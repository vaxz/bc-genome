4 scripts are used to get all the present data in those kinds of files : csv, faa and fasta.

"csv_file" recovers information on loci, genes and chromosomes in the csv files
In each csv file, the following fields must be presents:
num_locus;gene_Ref;gene_B0510;contig_B0510;gene_BC1G;contig_BC1G;locusDesc;gene_BcT4;contig_BcT4;BOFU;chromosome;directStrand;positionLocusBp

"fasta_file" recovers information on chromosomes (DNA sequences, chromosome numbers) in the fasta files
In thi script "Bcin" is considered as the reference gene.

"faa_file" recovers information on proteins (amino acid sequences, protein accession numbers) in the faa files

"main" is employed to launch the other scripts, to load the database and to manage the returned error values
This script contains the database connection variables. So , if necessary, change them.
This script needs only one argument : the chromosome number, example : sh ./main 18
